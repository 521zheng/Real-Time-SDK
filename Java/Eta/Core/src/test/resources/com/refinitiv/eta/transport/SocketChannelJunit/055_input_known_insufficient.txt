This input file tests the KNOWN_INSUFFICIENT state. When we are in
this state, we know the length of the "next" message, but there is
insufficient space in the read buffer to accommodate it. It contains
a RIPC handshake, and two messages described below.

For this unit test, we will override the capacity of the RsslSocketChannel 
buffer to be 35 bytes. The input file will contain two complete
messages that, combined, will exceeded the length of the input buffer.
Specifically, the first message we receive will have a total
length of 32 bytes. The second message we receive will
have a total length of 10 bytes. When the RsslSocketChannel (internally)
performs a network read, the entire first message, plus the first
three bytes of the second message will fill the entire read buffer.

After the first message is processed (by the application), the state
machine will transition from the KNOWN_COMPLETE state to the
KNOWN_INSUFFICENT state. This will require the buffer to be compacted
before the rest of the second message can be read.

The RIPC handshake:

The hex below combines two messages with lengths of 32, and 10,
respectively:
