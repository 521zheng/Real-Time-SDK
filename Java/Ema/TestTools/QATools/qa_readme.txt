Definition of QATools: The purpose of QATools is to test variations of examples (see Applications/Examples). For each example that is altered to run a test, there will be a directory here to represent that variation. Example: If Series400Consumer410 was altered 2 times to do 2 different tests, there will be directories here, such as, "Series400Consumer410*01" and "Series400Consumer410*02". In each directory are the files that have been altered. These directories contain ONLY the files that were altered for that example.

How to use QATools: For each QATool directory, user must copy or overlay the source files from that directory into the original location where the entire source for an example exists. The user must re-build the code to run the altered example.

Disclaimer:  Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of all test variations used in test.

Series400Consumer440-TsFrag-001
	Alters consumer to accept -bufSize and -fillSize as inputs.
	The bufSize is the size of buffer requested by getBuffer().  
	The fillSize is is the number of bytes written.  
	For example, if bufSize is 1000 and fillSize is 900, then the Consumer gets 
	a buffer of 1000 bytes but only writes 900 bytes before sending. The filled 
	buffer is sent to the provider/ads in fragments if larger than max fragment 
	size. This code change fills the buffer with "1, 2, 3....255" and repeats 
	this pattern of data up to the fillSize. The provider will then need to check 
	for the same pattern in the fully assembled message and print "TEST PASSED".
