This is the change log of the Elektron-SDK (ESDK) for Java. ESDK consists of both the Elektron Message API
(EMA) and the Elektron Transport API (ETA). This file contains history starting from ESDK 1.2.0 which is when
all components (EMA C++, EMA Java, ETA C, ETA Java) of ESDK are fully open sourced. Note that ESDK version
numbers start from 1.2.0 and EMA/ETA version numbers start from 3.2.0.

There are three types of ESDK releases that append a letter directly followed by a number to the version number.
"L" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.L1) are full ESDK releases that are uploaded to Customer Zone, Developer Community
and GitHub. "G" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.G1) are releases that are only uploaded to GitHub. "E" releases (E-Loads)
are emergency ESDK releases that are uploaded to Customer Zone and Developer Community but not to GitHub.
Also note that emergency releases may only be partial (i.e., Java or C++/C only).
