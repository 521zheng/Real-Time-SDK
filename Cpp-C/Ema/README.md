The Elektron Message API: This is an easy-to-use, performant, open source message layer API. The Elektron Message API helps developers by allowing them to develop applications with significantly less code. It is new and will be enhanced by collaboration with customers (through GitHub) and Thomson Reuters based on customer feedback.

EMA is written on top of the Elektron Transport API (ETA) utilizing    the Value Added Reactor and Watchlist.

# Message API Features and Functionality



##Consumer Features:

- ADS Multicast: Applications can connect to the ADS Multicast 
	  component by specifying the connection type RSSL_RELIABLE_MCAST.  
	  
- RSSL Encrypted and HTTP Connectivity

- Connection Failover: EMA can be configured to specify a 
	  list of failover servers via ChannelSet configuration.  In the event that the
	  consumer's connection attempt fails, EMA will utilize the next channel in 
	  the ChannelSet list.

- Default Admin Domain Requests: EMA uses default login, directory and 
      dictionary request while connecting to server. This provides minimum 
      configuration for applications to get up and running. 
	  
- Configurable Admin Domain Requests:  EMA provides means for modifying the
      default admin domain requests. 
      
- Tunnel Streams: EMA supports private streams, with additional associated 
      behaviors (e.g., end-to-end authentication, guaranteed delivery, and
      flow control).
	  
- Batch Request: Application may use a single request message to specify 
      interest in multiple items via the item list
	  
- Dynamic View:	Application may specify a subset of fields or elements of a 
      particular item
	  
- Optimized Pause and Resume: Application may request server to pause and 
      resume item stream
	
- Single Open: EMA supports application selected single open functionality
	  
	
- Programmatic Config	Enables application to programmatically specify and 
      overwrite EMA configuration
	

		
		
##Non-Interactive Provider Features:

- Default Admin Domains: EMA uses default login and directory messages while connecting to server. This provides minimum configuration for applications to get up and running.
 
- Configurable Admin Domains:  EMA provides means for modifying the default admin domain messages. 	


##Interactive Provider Features:

- Default Admin Domains: EMA uses default directory messages while sending to the connected client. This provides minimum configuration for applications to get up and running.
 
- Configurable Admin Domains:  EMA provides means for modifying the default admin domain messages. 	




##Common Features:

- TCP/IP Connectivity

- RMTES Decoder	EMA provides a built in RMTES decoder. IF desired, application
      may cache RmtesBuffer objects and apply all the received changes to them.
	
- Data::toString()	All OMM containers, primitives and messages may simply be
      printed out to screen in a standardized output format. 
	
- Data::getAsHex()	Applications may obtain binary representations of all OMM 
      containers, primitives and messages.

- File Config:	Enables applications to specify EMA configuration in an EmaConfig.xml file

	  - CentOS 7 64-bit (Qualified on OL7) **

** EMA is qualified on Oracle Linux Server 6.0 64-bit and CentOS 7 64-bit. Qualification was established by building on Red Hat AS 6.0 64-bit and Oracle Linux 7.0 64-bit, and by running the output on OL6 and CentOS 7, respectively. If you want to build source code on OL6 or CentOS 7, refer to the information in ETAâ€™s readme and replicate the OL6 or CentOS 7 build steps from the ETA Makefiles for the EMA components you want to build.

# Obtaining the Thomson Reuters Field Dictionaries


The Thomson Reuters `RDMFieldDictionary` and `enumtype.def` files are present in the GitHub repo under `Ema/Etc`.

In addition, the most current version can be downloaded from the Customer Zone from the following location.

https://customers.reuters.com/a/technicalsupport/softwaredownloads.aspx

- **Category**: MDS - General
- **Products**: TREP Templates Service Pack

Place the downloaded `enumtype.def` and `RDMFieldDictionary` under `/Ema/Etc` If these are not present when building some of the applications, their build will fail when they reach the step to copy these. The executable will still be built properly.
