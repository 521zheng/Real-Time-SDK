EmaCppConsPerf Application Description

--------
Summary:
--------
 
The purpose of this application is to measure performance of the EMA,
in consuming Level I Market Price content directly from an
OMM provider or through a Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System. 

The consumer creates two types of threads:
- A main thread, which collects and records statistical information,
- Consumer threads, each of which create a connection to a provider and
request market data.

To measure latency, a timestamp is randomly placed in each burst of updates by 
the provider.  The consumer then decodes the timestamp from the update to
determine the end-to-end latency.  

This application also measures memory and CPU usage.  The memory usage measured 
is the 'resident set,' or the memory currently in physical use by the 
application.  The CPU usage is the total time using the CPU divided by the 
total system time (The CPU time is the total across all threads, and as such 
this number can be greater than 100% if multiple threads are busy).  

This application uses Libxml2, an open source  XML parser library.
See the readme in the provided Libxml2 source for more details.

Setup Environment:
------------------

The following configuration files are required:
- RDMFieldDictionary and enumtype.def, located in the etc directory.
- 350k.xml, located in PerfTools/Common
- MsgData.xml, located in PerfTools/Common (only required if posting). Currently posting is not supported.
- EmaCppConsPerf includes the EMA library. For shared builds, the location of that
  library must be included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The library (libema.so) will be found in
  Ema/Libs/<env>/Optimized/Shared or Ema/Libs/<env>/Debug/Shared
  where <env> is your build directory (i.e., OL7_64_GCC482)
