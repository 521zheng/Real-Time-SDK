Summary
=======

450__MarketPrice__QueryServiceDiscovery is an OMM Consumer application example
that demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library in accessing
and parsing OMM MarketPrice data from Elektron Real Time in Cloud (ERT in cloud).

450__MarketPrice__QueryServiceDiscovery illustrates how to query endpoints from
EDP-RT service discovery using the ServiceEndpointDiscovery class and use the 
location from the command line to select an endpoint. The EMA's programmatic
configuration is used to to enable session management with the retrieved endpoint
for establishing a connection with ERT in cloud and consuming data. This application
requires a username and a password for authorization with the token service in order
to an access token for querying endpoints from the EDP service discovery and sending
login requests to ERT in cloud. EMA automatically refreshes the token to keep session
alive with the connecting provider


Detailed Description
====================

450__MarketPrice__QueryServiceDiscovery implements the following high-level steps:
+ Passes user credential through commandline arguments
including:
-username user name to perform authorization with the token service.
-password password to perform authorization with the token service.
-clientId client ID to perform authorization with the token service.
-location location to get an endpoint from EDP-RT service discovery. Now, it is either
 "us-east" by default or "eu-west".
-ph Proxy host name.
-pp Proxy port number.
-plogin User name on proxy server.
-ppasswd Password on proxy server.
-pdomain Proxy Domain.

+ Implements OmmConsumerClient class in AppClient
  - Overrides desired methods
+ Instantiates an AppClient object to receive and process item messages
+ Instantiates a Map (configMap object) and populates it with configuration info
+ Instantiates and modifies an OmmConsumerConfig object
  - Sets the user credential
  - Sets the consumer name to "Consumer_3"
  - sets Omm Consumer configuration with data from the programmatic configuration
+ Instantiates an OmmConsumer object which initializes the connection 
  and send login request to the endpoint of the specified location.
+ Opens a streaming item interest
  - MarketPrice IBM.N item from the ELEKTRON_DD service
+ Processes data received from the API for 900 seconds
  - All received messages are processed on the API's thread of control
+ Exits
