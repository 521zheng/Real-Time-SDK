Summary
=======

113__MarketPrice__SessionManagement is an OMM Consumer application example
that demonstrates basic usage of the EMA library in accessing
and parsing OMM MarketPrice data from Elektron Real Time in Cloud (ERT in cloud).

113__MarketPrice__SessionManagement illustrates how to use the EMA's configuration file
to enable session management and specify a location to get an endpoint for establishing
a connection with ERT in cloud and consuming data. This application requires a username
and a password for authorization with the token service in order to an access token for
querying endpoints from the EDP service discovery and sending login requests to ERT in
cloud. EMA automatically refreshes the token to keep session alive with the connecting
provider


Detailed Description
====================

113__MarketPrice__SessionManagement implements the following high-level steps:
+ Passes user credential through commandline arguments
including:
-username user name to perform authorization with the token service.

+ Implements OmmConsumerClient class in AppClient
  - Overrides desired methods
+ Instantiates an AppClient object to receive and process item messages
+ Instantiates and modifies an OmmConsumerConfig object
  - Sets the user credential
  - Sets the consumer name to "Consumer_3"
  - Loads configuration information for the specified consumer name
    from the EmaConfig.xml file in the application's working folder
+ Instantiates an OmmConsumer object which initializes the connection 
  and send login request to the endpoint of the specified location.
+ Opens a streaming item interest
  - MarketPrice IBM.N item from the ELEKTRON_DD service
+ Processes data received from the API for 900 seconds
  - All received messages are processed on the API's thread of control
