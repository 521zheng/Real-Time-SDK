This is the change log of the Elektron-SDK (ESDK) for C++/C. ESDK consists of both the Elektron Message API
(EMA) and the Elektron Transport API (ETA). This file contains history starting from ESDK 1.2.0 which is when
all components (EMA C++, EMA Java, ETA C, ETA Java) of ESDK are fully open sourced. Note that ESDK version
numbers start from 1.2.0 and EMA/ETA version numbers start from 3.2.0.

There are three types of ESDK releases that append a letter directly followed by a number to the version number.
"L" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.L1) are full ESDK releases that are uploaded to Customer Zone, Developer Community
and GitHub. "G" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.G1) are releases that are only uploaded to GitHub. "E" releases (E-Loads)
are emergency ESDK releases that are uploaded to Customer Zone and Developer Community but not to GitHub.
Also note that emergency releases may only be partial (i.e., Java or C++/C only).

ESDK C++/C Release 1.2.0.L1 (April 27, 2018)
--------------------------------------------

New Features Added
------------------

ESDK C/C++ now utilizes a CMake build environment. Refer to the ESDK C/C++ Migration Guide for detailed
instructions regarding how to build EMA C++ with CMake.

ESDK C/C++ now supports Visual Studio 2017.

EMA now supports encrypted connection type.

ETA C is now fully open sourced except for reliable multicast transport and VA cache. Open source
transports include TCP, HTTP, HTTP encrypted, shared memory and sequenced multicast transport types.
The OMM encoder and decoder have also been open sourced.

Note that the memory footprint has increased this release due to the following:

Around 20 MB is introduced by changing the container type for handling message fragmentation.
The hash table is initialized when a rsslChannelImpl is created which ETA allocates 10 of them
upfront for this first initialization of Rssl library.

Around 4.6 MB is introduced by the new functionality of RsslDataDictionary to look up
RsslDictionaryEntry by name (rsslDictionaryGetEntryByFieldName).
