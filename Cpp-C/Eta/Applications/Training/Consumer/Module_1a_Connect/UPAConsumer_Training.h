 * This is the UPA Consumer Training series of the UPA Training Suite
 * applications. The purpose of this application is to show step-by-step 
 * training how to build a UPA OMM Consumer using the UPA Transport layer.
 *
 * Main h header file for the UPA Consumer Training application. It is a 
 * single-threaded client application.
 *
 ************************************************************************
 * UPA Consumer Training Module 1a: Establish network communication
 ************************************************************************
 * Summary:
 * In this module, the application initializes the UPA Transport and 
 * connects the client. An OMM consumer application can establish a 
 * connection to other OMM Interactive Provider applications, including 
 * Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution Systems, Refinitiv Data Feed Direct,
 * and Refinitiv Real-Time. 
 *
 * Detailed Descriptions:
 * The first step of any UPA consumer application is to establish a 
 * network connection with its peer component (i.e., another application 
 * with which to interact). An OMM consumer typically creates an outbound 
 * connection to the well-known hostname and port of a server (Interactive 
 * Provider or ADS). The consumer uses the rsslConnect() function to initiate 
 * the connection and then uses the rsslInitChannel() function to complete 
 * channel initialization.
 *
